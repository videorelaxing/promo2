   VELOCUT PRO - HIGH SPEED IMAGE WORKFLOW ENGINE
   Version: 1.0

========================================================================

1. INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
VeloCut is not just an image viewer; it is a high-performance workflow 
accelerator designed for professionals who need to process large volumes 
of images with maximum speed.

Philosophy: "VIEW. EDIT. NEXT."

Unlike traditional editors that require complex menu navigation, VeloCut 
relies on flow-state editing. Mouse gestures, instant shortcuts, and 
smart automation allow you to edit, save, and jump to the next image 
in milliseconds.


2. KEY FEATURES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* REPEAT & GO [R]: Automates your workflow. Apply crops, filters, and 
  adjustments to one image, then automatically apply the same logic to 
  the next file in the folder while saving instantly.

* REMOTE INTERCOM CLONE: Open multiple instances of VeloCut and clone 
  pixels seamlessly from one window to another without quality loss.

* SMART RETOUCH: Includes frequency separation (Dynamic Retouch), 
  privacy pixelation, and auto-masking tools.

* MEDICAL & VFX READY: Native support for DICOM (Window/Level), EXR, 
  and RAW formats.


3. GETTING STARTED
------------------------------------------------------------------------
VeloCut is designed to be controlled via Mouse & Keyboard shortcuts to 
keep the interface clean.

-> PRESS [F1] IN THE APP TO OPEN THE "VELOCUT ENCYCLOPEDIA".
   This built-in guide lists all shortcuts and hidden features.

Basic Controls:
[Right Click] ...... Pick Color
[Wheel] ............ Zoom
[Shift + Wheel] .... Brush Size
[Alt + Wheel] ...... Opacity
[R] ................ Repeat & Go (Save & Next)


4. FOLDER STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To ensure data safety, VeloCut never overwrites your original files 
by default (unless you explicitly force it).

It automatically creates these subfolders in your image directory:
* /VeloCut_changed ... Processed/Edited images are saved here.
* /VeloCut_trash ..... Deleted files are moved here (Safety Net).
